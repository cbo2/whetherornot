# whetherornot
In a nutshell, this app will allow the user a clean interface to check weather for a future dated vacation.
The idea here is that if you are planning a significant vacation in advance and knew the weather stats,
you may wish you had planned your trip at another date.  This app will help you predict the weather for your
desired destination in advance and then change the date to better align with your weather desires.  So, the 
idea is __**whether or not**__ you shoud go to that destination on a given date __or switch it to another date__.  Yes, 
we know the difference between weather and whether ;-)
