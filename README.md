# whetherornot
In a nutshell, this app will allow the user a clean interface to check weather for a future dated vacation.
The idea here is that if you are planning a significant vacation in advance and knew the weather stats,
you may wish you had planned your trip at another date.  This app will help you predict the weather for your
desired destination in advance and then change the date to better align with your weather desires.  So, the 
idea is **whether or not** you shoud go to that destination on a given date or switch it to another date.  Yes, 
we know the difference between weather and whether ;-)
